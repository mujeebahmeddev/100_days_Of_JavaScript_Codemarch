// JavaScript comments
/* 
1. What are comments?
- Comments are like notes in your code. 
- They help you remember what you were thinking when you wrote the code. 
- JavaScript ignores these comments when running the code.
*/


/*
Why use comments?
- To remind yourself what a piece of code does.
- To let others understand your code easily.
- To temporarily stop a part of your code from running when testing.
*/

// Single-line comment example:

// // This line of code will show a message in a web browser's console
// console.log("Hello, Folks!"); // Hello, Folks!


// Multi-line comment example:

// /*
// These lines are ignored by JavaScript.
// You can write your notes or temporarily
// disable a block of code.
// */
// console.log("This line is still running.");


/* 2. console.log() in JavaScript

`console.log()` is a way to show messages or values of variables in the web browser's console (a part of the web browser where developers can see messages, errors, etc.).


Why use `console.log()`?

- To find and fix mistakes in your code (debug).
*/

// Example

// console.log(favoriteFood); // This will show the word "Maggi" in the console
